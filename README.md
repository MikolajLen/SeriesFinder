# SeriesFinder

Application for querying series using `tvmaze` API

## Note

This is not the final version of the application - it is only a result after the first 4 hours of work.

To finish the application, I need to:
- add progress during data loading
- handle the errors in some way
- persist the video player state
- implement some way to refresh the list (i.e. pull to refresh)
- add tests for the player fragment
- add instrumented tests
- manually tests the app
- polish up UI a little bit
